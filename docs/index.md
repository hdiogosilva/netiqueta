**É Bué Fixe Ser Fixe Online**,  
_roughly_ translated to "It's Super Cool to Be Cool Online",  
it's an educational game targeting Portuguese children between the ages of 8 and 10.

Netiquette is an important topic, and our goal is to show kids how _being cool online_ can be cool!

It came together as a result of the [Hackathon in Digital Communication and Literacy](https://www.hackathonpractices.com/) promoted EUGLOH and U.Porto.

Whether you want to learn more about the project or just play the game, you've come to the right place!
