Wanna know more about the development of our game?  
You've come to the right place!

From conceptual work, to graphical asset iterations to the technical development, you'll all the details here!

## The Concept

During the first phase of the hackathon the team was focused with nailing down overall concept! During this process we identified the _Problem_, who is our _target audience_, what's the _message_ we're trying to convey and the creative _insight_ we're using to spread our message.  

You can find our final pitch, condensing all these elements in the presentation bellow:

## Game Development

With these builing blocks layd out in the initial phase of the hackathon the team could delve deeper into developing a prototype of the game to further show its potential!

## The Constraints

Due to the hackathon setting and all the time constraints associated with it, the following technical choices were made from the start:

+ The game will be developed to be played in a web browser without requiring instalation of any software;
+ The game will only be optimized for desktop browsers;
+ The [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) will be used for development;
+ The game will be single player only;
+ The game will be limited to "three characters" and "three levels" (whatever that ends up meaning);
+ The game will tackle three principles of netiquete: **be kind**, **keep personal information private**, and **respect others’s wishes**.


These base definitions allowed the team to start a _mini_-brainstorm for game mechanics and features that are from the get got restrained by the technical devlopment, as this is the more time consuming element.

### Game Mechanics & Concept Expantion

When thinking about the game and how to engage children from 8 to 10 years of age, the moto of "make it fun" kept bouncing around in our minds. The game would have to be bring kids in from the get go if we want to capture their atention and really get our message across.

In that sense we started to think about emulating the enviroment of online gaming. After all, netiquete is our core concept. Our set up is:  

!!! tip "É Bué Fixe Ser Fixe Online"
    **Our player is gaming with his two (maybe best) friends. We are facing different challenges, and the way that our player interacts with his friends in these challenges can help or hinder his progress in the different levels**  

This way we have not only the challenges of the levels themselves, but also the interactions with other players to bring out the netiquete principles.

Dissecting our setup above we get:

+ **"Our player is gaming with his two (maybe best) friends"**: we need to portray these three players (we included) and that we are all playing these online game.
+ **"We are facing different challenges"**: the core gameplay will be a set of 3 mini-games with different mechanics. The player can tackle these in any order and will earn badges when completing each. The mini-games will be developed around the netiquete core concepts;
+ **"the way that our player interacts with his friends in these challenges [has effects on the player outcomes]"**: on top of the overall goal of the mini-game, the different interactions the player has will alter the way the game plays out.

From this definition we started developing the concepts for our 3 mini-games.  
After some brainstorming we came up with:

1. "O Labirinto" (The Labyrinth): where the player has to cross a somewhat complex labyrinth, while also finding the friends allong the way;
2. "A Ponte Emoji (The Emoji Bridge"): a platforming challenge where the player has to collect all the emoji with some hiden mechanics to be found...
3. "O Salto Conjunto" (Group Jump): where the player has to help one of the friends in acomplishing a scary jump!
